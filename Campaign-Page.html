	For my campain page my problem is that religous conflicts are causing problems around the world and they are causing conflicts with the country and other political problems. For a solution I think think there can be one, I think this because every person have there own opinon and each person thinks they correct and the other person is wrong. This is why these conflicts that happen because one side  say there religon is correct while the other side they are wrong.But I there is a solution to stop the harrasment of different religons. I think we should accpet people's cultures and should let them follow what they want. My action is to make a pettion to stop this harrasment to different cultures and what they belive in.
